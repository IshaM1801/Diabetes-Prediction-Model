# PIMA Diabetes Prediction

This project uses the PIMA Diabetes Dataset to predict whether a person has diabetes based on various health parameters. The dataset is processed, and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used for the prediction.

## Project Structure

- `diabetes_prediction.py`: Main script for data processing, model training, and prediction.
- `diabetes (1).csv`: Dataset file (make sure the path is correctly set in the script).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.6+).
3. Install the required packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage

1. Place the dataset file `diabetes (1).csv` in the appropriate directory.
2. Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python diabetes_prediction.py
   ```

3. The script will load the data, preprocess it, train an SVM model, and make predictions. The accuracy of the model on both the training and test sets will be printed, along with a prediction for a sample input.

## Code Explanation

### Data Loading

The data is loaded using pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the data
diabetes_data = pd.read_csv(r"C:/Users/Isha/Downloads/diabetes (1).csv")
print(diabetes_data.head())
print(diabetes_data.shape)
```

### Data Preprocessing

The data is standardized using `StandardScaler`:

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Standardize the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X = diabetes_data.drop(columns='Outcome', axis=1)
Y = diabetes_data['Outcome']
scaler.fit(X)
standardized_data = scaler.transform(X)
```

### Train-Test Split

The data is split into training and test sets:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(standardized_data, Y, test_size=0.2, stratify=Y, random_state=2)
```

### Model Training

An SVM classifier is used to train the model:

```python
from sklearn import svm
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Initialize and train the classifier
classifier = svm.SVC(kernel='linear')
classifier.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# Evaluate the model
X_train_prediction = classifier.predict(X_train)
training_data_accuracy = accuracy_score(X_train_prediction, Y_train)
X_test_prediction = classifier.predict(X_test)
test_data_accuracy = accuracy_score(X_test_prediction, Y_test)
print('Training Data Accuracy:', training_data_accuracy)
print('Test Data Accuracy:', test_data_accuracy)
```

### Prediction

A sample input is used to make a prediction:

```python
input_data = (6, 148, 72, 35, 0, 33.6, 0.627, 50)
input_data_as_numpy_array = np.asarray(input_data)
input_data_reshaped = input_data_as_numpy_array.reshape(1, -1)
std_data = scaler.transform(input_data_reshaped)
prediction = classifier.predict(std_data)
print('Prediction:', 'Diabetic' if prediction[0] == 1 else 'Non-Diabetic')
```

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to use machine learning for medical data analysis and prediction. The model provides a reasonable accuracy and can be further improved with more sophisticated techniques and hyperparameter tuning.
